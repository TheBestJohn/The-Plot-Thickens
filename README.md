# The Plot Thickens
Collected works from around github that create Vector images that are neat to plot on a cnc plotter/modified printer

[Scribbleplot](https://github.com/bleeptrack/scribbleplot)
- controlP5

https://github.com/jasonwebb/SuperformulaSVG

[SuperformulaSVG](https://github.com/jasonwebb/SuperformulaSVG)
Could be **VERY** cool with puregcode printint as well

[ShapePanel](https://github.com/ZachHofmeister/ShapePlane)
Makes some cool shapes, saves to `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\Documents\ShapePlan\images` as PDF.

[raster plotter](https://github.com/ivangrozny/raster-plotter) //Not working? 
requires The Midibus and Drop libraries

[Halftone Color](https://github.com/ArchtechJohan/halftoneColor)

## Interesting but needs tweaking

[VectorFieldSketch](https://github.com/FreedomGrenade/VectorFieldSketch)
needs adding a `settings()` function for the image size and may neer it's size hardcoded. Produces jpegs but they are visually interesting. May be what some are looking for.
